I am an Associate Professor of Political Science at [Bowling Green State University](https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/political-science/faculty-and-staff-directory/Bhati.html).

I have received the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Award to India for the academic year 2025â€“26 and will serve as a research scholar in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences at the [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD)](https://hss.iitd.ac.in)

My overarching research agenda lies at the intersection of nonprofit and civil society organizations, political science, and public administration. In particular, I am interested in understanding how nonprofits generate resources and the role they play in reducing structural social, economic, and political inequalities. I also study how the state either promotes or curtails the freedom of nonprofits and civil societies, both in the U.S. and in comparative contexts.

I also serve as a member of the planning commission for the [City of Bowling Green, Ohio](https://www.bgohio.org/) and as a Trustee of the [Bowling Green Community Foundation](https://www.bgohcf.org/).
