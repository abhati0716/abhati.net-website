I view every student as a gifted individual with unique skills and perspectives. Guided by my personal teaching philosophy, I see myself as a motivator and facilitator who helps each student reach their full potential while meeting the learning objectives of the course.

To achieve this, I create an engaging and meaningful learning experience by using a variety of teaching tools—such as case studies, guest speakers, and reflective writing based on course-related videos or films—alongside traditional lectures and class discussions.
